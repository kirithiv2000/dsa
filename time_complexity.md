#What website can I use to test my code time complexity?
Time complexity isn’t something you test, it’s something you prove. If you want to know the computational complexity of the algorithm you’re implementing, you should analyze the algorithm.

If you’re having trouble analyzing the complexity of your code, you can try timing it with different input sizes to get an idea of how the run time increase with larger inputs, but this won’t give you a definitive answer because your algorithm may behave differently on inputs you didn’t test and you might interpret the data incorrectly.
